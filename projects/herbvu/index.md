[HerbVu](https://herbvu.com) is one of the first webapps I made. I made it because I wanted a way to identify the best offers on special grocery products like sweeteners, nut flours, tea, etc. – basically things I buy on [iHerb](https://iherb.com). Since iHerb has a great affiliate program, I thought this was a viable business. It turned out developing the site is just one third of the job. The rest is marketing, outreach, SEO, and UX design – which is harder for me to do casually. I learned a ton making it and still kinda believe in the idea.

Som effort should be made to find out whether there is a market for an idea like this. The market for these things is quite large and worldwide and it's growing too. I would make the site from scratch again with Nuxt or something, and go heavy on the outreach and marketing.
