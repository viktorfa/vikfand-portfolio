[inneklemtedager.no](https://inneklemtedager.no) is a simple website that gives an overview of what's known in Norway as _sqeezed days_. These are work days squeezed between two holidays, or a holiday and a weekend. People are generally free to choose which days to take out vacation days on in Norway, so taking a squeezed day off can give you a looong weekend to go skiing or something.

This website actually got featured in some [online news outlets](https://www.nrk.no/ostfold/neste-var-blir-det-inneklemt-fest-1.13545988) in 2017, which made it go viral for a while. Unfortunately, it has no monetization strategy.
