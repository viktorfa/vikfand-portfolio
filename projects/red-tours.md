[RÃ¸de reiser](https://viktorfa.github.io/red-tours) is a travel agency specializing in travels to China with a focus on revolutionary history. What is known as red tourism has seen a global downturn since its heyday in the 1960-70s. VFA Solutions helped give the concept a modern image reflected in sleek design in combination with classic posters from past eras.

The site is made entirely in the Vue static site generator Gridsome. It leverages the framework's support for various data sources to use both Markdown and JSON data as content.
